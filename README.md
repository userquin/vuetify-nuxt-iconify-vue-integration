This repository is an example of how to integrate [Iconify for Vue](https://iconify.design/docs/icon-components/vue/) icons in a Nuxt application using [vuetify-nuxt-module](https://github.com/userquin/vuetify-nuxt-module).

**WARNING**: Not all icons have been included, you will need to review the [iconify/index.ts](iconify/index.ts) file including the icons you want to use.
